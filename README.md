# The KGC Book Club Ontology

The goal of the KGC Book Club Ontology Working Group is to support ongoing learning and community efforts around the KGC Book Club program.

The plan is to bring together KGC Book Club members with diverse perspectives and experience to create ontologies related to Book Club topics, and to produce prototypes of interest and value to the wider KGC community.

The broader goal of the project is to produce artifacts that are accessible to a wider audience looking to understand Semantic Web standards and their relation to Knowledge Graph technologies.
